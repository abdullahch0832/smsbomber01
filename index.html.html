How SMS Bombers Work

<a href="https://www.smsbomberz.com/">SMS bombers!</a>, also known as SMS flooders, are tools or apps that allow a user to send a large number of SMS text messages to a target phone number in a short amount of time. The goal is to flood the target with so many messages that their phone is overwhelmed and becomes unusable. 

SMS bombers utilize flaws in the architecture of cellular networks to bypass limits on sending SMS at scale. Here’s an overview of how they work:

The Basics

- SMS bombers access the SMS protocol, which is used for sending text messages over cellular networks. When you send a text from your phone, it goes through your carrier's systems and gets routed to the recipient's carrier.

- Typically, carriers limit the number of SMS messages an individual user can send in a given period of time to prevent abuse. SMS bombers are designed to circumvent these limits.

- SMS bombers work by rapidly sending hundreds or thousands of messages to a target number from a large pool of SIM cards. This spreads the message load across many different sources, making it hard for carriers to block.

Bypassing Carrier Limits

- Carriers use two main methods to limit SMS sending - blocking specific numbers that send too many texts, and requiring senders to authenticate with an access token or captcha after sending a certain amount.

- SMS bombers get around these by constantly cycling through a large pool of SIM cards. When one number gets blocked, the bomber simply switches to another SIM.

- Some SMS bombers use hacked SIM cards which don't need authentication. Others solve captchas automatically or have large teams of humans that can bypass the authentication manually.

Automating Message Sending

- SMS bombers are automated tools that can send thousands of messages without human intervention. They connect to a database of phone numbers and SIM cards and rapidly cycle through them.

- Many bombers offer a web-based interface allowing users to enter a target phone number, customize settings like message frequency, and launch an attack with one click.

- More advanced bombers may use machine learning to optimize message timing to avoid detection, or offer SMS spoofing to make messages look like they’re coming from different sources.

Acquiring Phone Numbers 

- For SMS bombers to work effectively, they need a constant supply of new SIM cards and phone numbers. These are acquired through a few methods:

- Buying expired and unused SIM cards in bulk from sellers. These can often still receive SMS even if no longer usable on networks.

- Using hundreds or thousands of new prepaid SIM cards, discarding them after they get blocked.

- Grabbing inactive phone numbers through breaches of cell providers or database leaks. Numbers are cycled through even if unavailable.

Anonymizing Bomber Activity

- Since SMS bombing is illegal in many places, bombers use technical tricks to try and mask the source of the messages:

- Routing traffic through VPNs, proxies, and TOR to disguise the bomber's real IP address.

- Constantly switching between SIM cards and phone numbers.

- Using SMS spoofing to falsify the message's originating number.

- Operating through botnets, making it hard to trace back to the bomber.

Overall, SMS bombers leverage flaws in cellular networks, automation, and throwaway SIMs/numbers to overwhelm targets with text messages. Their techniques are constantly evolving as carriers attempt to improve security.

Common Uses of SMS Bombers

SMS bombers are used maliciously in several common ways:

- Swatting - bombarding a target with texts that contain threats or warnings to trigger an emergency response.

- Stalking/harassment - flooding a victim with unwanted messages.

- Extortion - demanding payment to stop a SMS bombing attack.

- Scams - sending texts about fake emergencies, viruses, account lockouts, etc.

- Disrupting operations - overwhelming a business' communication channels with nonsense texts.

- Competitive disruption - sabotaging a rival by tying up their phone lines. 

- Protesting - activism aimed at disrupting organizations via SMS spam.

While SMS bombing may seem like a harmless prank, it can constitute a serious crime in many jurisdictions when used with malicious intent.

Potential Damages from SMS Bombing Attacks

- Makes the target's phone unusable by clogging the screen with endless messages.

- Drains the phone's battery life extremely quickly as it struggles to load so many texts.

- Uses up the target's prepaid SMS allowance rapidly, forcing them to buy more.

- Triggers fees or service suspensions on postpaid plans once limits are hit.

- Ties up the target's phone number so legitimate calls/messages can't get through.

- Causes stress and panic if texts contain threats or disturbing content.

- Disrupts business operations if targeting company phones/numbers.

- Incurs costs for operators as infrastructure strains under excessive texts.

- Enables other crimes like swatting, stalking, fraud, etc.

Overall, SMS bombers can inflict damage ranging from temporary nuisance to serious harm depending on the context.

Are SMS Bombers Legal? 

The legality of SMS bombers varies between jurisdictions:

- In the U.S., SMS bombing is likely illegal under federal laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Telephone Harassment Act, and may constitute cyberstalking or extortion under state laws.

- The European Union prohibits tools for "preventing, inhibiting, or intercepting" telecom services, which likely includes SMS bombers. Penalties can be steep fines.

- Countries like Australia, India, and the Phillipines have laws explicitly banning SMS spamming, flooding and bombing.

- Some Middle Eastern nations classify SMS bombing as a cybercrime or telecom disruption punishable by fines, jail time or both. 

- Parts of Africa and South America have weaker telecom laws that do not clearly prohibit SMS bombers.

However, even where not explicitly outlawed, SMS bombing can often be charged as harassment, threats, or disruption of telecom services under broader laws in most countries. The non-consensual nature and malicious use makes it illegal in most jurisdictions.

Defending Against SMS Bombers

There are a few ways targets can try to defend themselves against SMS bombing attacks:

- Contact cell provider - They can attempt to block suspect numbers, increase filtering, or offer new number.

- Use call blocking apps - Apps like Truecaller can block known spam numbers and bombers.

- Disable notifications - Turn off notifications for non-contacts to avoid disruption.

- Switch to VoIP - Use VoIP apps like WhatsApp or Signal for texts instead of your main number.

- Ask contacts to text instead - Have friends/family reach you via online messaging while attack is ongoing.

- Report to police - If threats or harassment, file a report so they can request number traces.

- Never engage - Don't respond to random texts as it confirms an active number.

Unfortunately, SMS bombing is hard to fully defend against due to flaws in protocols carriers rely on. Avoiding escalation and reporting issues is usually the safest approach.

The Future of SMS Bombing 

Despite increased efforts by cell providers to upgrade security, SMS bombing remains relatively easy to execute today in most regions. However, a few trends may limit bombers in the future:

- Migration to VoIP-based messaging - As services like WhatsApp replace SMS, built-in protections could reduce vulnerability.

- Implementation of new protocols - Upgrades like RCS aim to bring SMS into the modern messaging era.

- AI detection - Carriers are deploying machine learning to spot flooding patterns and shut them down quicker. 

- Increased regulation - More governments are passing laws specifically banning tools/services dedicated to SMS bombing.

- Improved authentication - Captchas and other checks before sending SMS can help curb automation.

While SMS bombing may never fully go away given the nature of cellular networks, its potency could decline significantly in years to come through technological and legal advances. However, new techniques will likely emerge as bombers adapt.

FAQ

Here are some common questions about SMS bombers and flooding attacks:
